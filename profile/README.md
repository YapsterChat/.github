**Yapster** is an up-and-coming messaging platform that reinvents the wheel, but puts shiny bells and whistles to justify the price! Just kidding, the app is **free!** (free is very cheap I think)

### Supercharge Your Friendships
Yapster takes social to a whole larger level, with features that emphasize the person, not the chat. Through beautifully crafted innovative ideas, we **_supercharge_** your friendships by upholding three simple principles:
* **Be User-Centric**: A feature is only a feature if it benefits the end-user. 
* **Have A Social Focus**: Talking to someone _is_ socializing, but what if we can expand more? We expand on the basics of socializing, by adding features which replicate real-life aspects as well!
* **Fun**: We also want you to have great deal of fun! So yeah have fun (or else!!!! :trollface:)
